# 07_spring-workspace

ðŸ˜Š This repository includes what I learned about the Spring Framework. <br>

âœ¨ I created a new project, built a simple website, and learned the theory through practice. <br>
âœ¨ I applied what I learned before, such as ajax. <br>
âœ¨ Additionally, it was developed using open API provided by public data portals.
